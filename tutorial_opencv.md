# OpenCV Overview

## What is OpenCV?

**OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library)** is an open-source computer vision and machine learning library designed to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications. It contains a comprehensive set of tools for image and video analysis, including face detection, object tracking, image filtering, and more.

OpenCV is widely used in applications such as:
- Real-time image and video processing.
- Object detection and recognition.
- Augmented reality (AR).
- Robotics and autonomous vehicles.

## Features of OpenCV

- **Multiplatform**: Runs on Windows, Linux, macOS, iOS, and Android.
- **Wide Language Support**: Bindings for C++, Python, Java, and more.
- **Real-Time Performance**: Optimized for real-time applications.
- **Extensive Algorithms**: Includes hundreds of algorithms for image processing, object detection, and machine learning.

## Step-by-Step: Setting Up OpenCV with C++

### 1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- **CMake**: For building OpenCV.
- **A C++ Compiler**: GCC/Clang (Linux/macOS) or MSVC (Windows).
- **Git**: To clone the OpenCV repository.
- **Dependencies**: Libraries like `build-essential`, `libjpeg`, `libpng`, `zlib`, etc., are required for building OpenCV. On Linux, install them with:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install build-essential cmake git libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libtiff-dev libgtk-3-dev
  ```

---

### 2. Download OpenCV Source Code
Clone the OpenCV and OpenCV Contrib repositories:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv.git
git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib.git
```

---

### 3. Build OpenCV
1. Create a build directory:
   ```bash
   cd opencv
   mkdir build && cd build
   ```

2. Run `cmake` with desired options:
   ```bash
   cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
         -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local \
         -DOPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH=../../opencv_contrib/modules \
         ..
   ```

3. Compile OpenCV:
   ```bash
   make -j$(nproc)
   ```

4. Install OpenCV:
   ```bash
   sudo make install
   ```

---

### 4. Verify Installation
To ensure OpenCV is installed correctly, check the version using the `pkg-config` tool:
```bash
pkg-config --modversion opencv4
```

---

## Sample OpenCV Program in C++

Hereâ€™s a basic C++ example to read and display an image using OpenCV:

### Code
```cpp
#include <opencv2/opencv.hpp>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // Read an image from file
    cv::Mat image = cv::imread("sample.jpg");
    if (image.empty()) {
        std::cerr << "Could not read the image!" << std::endl;
        return -1;
    }

    // Display the image in a window
    cv::imshow("Displayed Image", image);

    // Wait for a key press indefinitely
    cv::waitKey(0);

    return 0;
}
```

---

### Compile and Run
1. Save the code to a file, e.g., `display_image.cpp`.
2. Compile the program using `g++`:
   ```bash
   g++ -o display_image display_image.cpp `pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv4`
   ```

3. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./display_image
   ```

Make sure you have a file named `sample.jpg` in the same directory as the executable, or adjust the file path in the code.
